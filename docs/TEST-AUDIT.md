# Test-suite audit & fix plan (2026-07-18)

A full survey of every automated test — 44 Playwright e2e specs (~190 cases,
`v2/tests/*.spec.ts`) and 25 Node smoke/validate scripts (`v2/scripts/*.mjs`) —
asking of each: *does it test the intended thing in the best way?* The hunt was
for the failure mode that shipped in **Batch 258**: a control renders, but the
data flow behind it is dead, and the test stays green (`collectVars` stopped
descending into `columns`, killing every 5e-sheet `$var`; the layout spec proved
presence, never rolled, so it never caught it — fixed in B261).

**Verdict:** strong in aggregate (real round-trips, good negative paths, a
byte-identical Earth reproducibility anchor). The weakness is *patterned* and
clusters in the highest-value places: the character sheet, the map layers, and
the HP/geography numbers.

## Tags
`PRESENCE` render-not-behavior · `TAUTOLOGY` tests a copy of the code ·
`PASSES-IF-BROKEN` loose assertion · `WEAK-BOUND` shape not value ·
`FLAKY` wall-clock/race · `MISSING` no test · `BRITTLE` churns without catching ·
`FIXTURE-BYPASS` skips the real path.

## The 7 systemic patterns
1. **Presence, not behavior** (the B258 class) — `character-sheet-5e:21`,
   `live-sheet:226`, `homebrew-import:28`, `choice-block:11/49`,
   `character-sheet:133`. Fix: assert the *outcome* of the interaction.
2. **Tautology / tests-a-copy** — `road-field:137` (re-implements the width
   ladder), `person-disposition:56` (`selectOption`→`toHaveValue`),
   `settlement-fields:9` (persistence masquerading as determinism),
   `smoke-templates` (slotSeeds contract deferred to e2e).
3. **Passes-if-broken** — `legend:28/56` (pixel-diff dominated by the wash),
   `map-artifacts:47` (passes if rivers vanish), `rollers:98/50`,
   `smoke-srd-statblocks:118` (attribution greens vacuously), `brews:32/73`.
4. **Weak-bound smokes** — HP (`smoke-dnd5e:81/192`, least-tested number in the
   engine), `smoke-hydro` (no downhill/sink invariant), `smoke-geo` (features vs
   terrain), `smoke-terrain:124` (G-3), `smoke-settle` (highway connectivity).
5. **Flaky by construction** — `map-perf:52/84` (p95<100ms), reload-without-
   durability-wait (`live-sheet:41`, `sheet-editor:11`, `rollers:69`),
   `dice-skins` (2.4s stage auto-dismiss).
6. **Missing coverage** — tracker/actions never ticked/rolled on a real inserted
   block; dice `kl/dh`; foreign-world hash rejection + hash-write on pan;
   secret-field/photo durability; `visual-audit` never `expect()`s consoleErrors
   or longtask ms.
7. **Brittle** — exact statGrid counts, exact-rgb dice skins, exact-monster
   `gm-prep:55`, exact Earth census `earth-browser` (never asserts the
   fantasy-name-on-real-coords claim it exists for).

## Solid — do not churn
entity-mentions, share-link (incl. secrets-stay-home), solo-play + oracle cast,
realm-entry, map-card, tree/tree-pane, page-view, the field smokes
(river/road/wind/current/sailing), smoke-realms, smoke-merge, **smoke-reproducible**
(the anchor). `smoke-srd-statblocks`' full-output-minus-cast compare is the model
for "content never steers dice" — copy it to `smoke-solo-cast`.

## Fix batches

### Batch 1 — sheet behavior gaps (the B258 class)  ← IN PROGRESS
- [ ] `character-sheet-5e.spec.ts` — NEW test: composite, play mode, roll a
      columns-nested ability box + a Saving Throw chip; assert the resolved
      `(str.mod)`/`(prof)` reaches the dice stage (guards the B258 var-scope at
      the e2e layer, complementing `char-play:22` and `smoke-dnd5e:253`).
- [ ] `live-sheet.spec.ts:226` — click an ability button, assert the stage rolls
      with the modifier (presence → behavior; static-template surface).
- [ ] `choice-block.spec.ts:11` — change the composite subclass dropdown, reload,
      assert it stuck (the composite-emitted choice is on the commit sink).
- [ ] `choice-block.spec.ts:49` — assert metamagic's pool holds real options and
      a pick persists across reload.
- [ ] `homebrew-import.spec.ts:28` — positively assert the h4 became the table's
      LABEL ("Random Encounters" inside `.b-table`), not just "not a heading".

### Batch 2 — kill the tautologies
- [ ] `road-field.spec.ts:137` — assert the *real* road width (expose a pure
      `roadLineWidth(kind,ppf)` from mapView and import it, or assert rendered
      thickness grows between two zooms) instead of a re-implemented ladder.
- [ ] `person-disposition.spec.ts:56` — reload + re-open, assert the disposition
      edit persisted (prove the field-commit handler ran).
- [ ] `settlement-fields.spec.ts:9` — clear the four fields / open a second fresh
      city to test *re-derivation*, and tighten one field to a world-consistent
      value.
- [ ] `smoke-templates.mjs` — add a pure assertion that `slotSeeds(config,'s')`
      aligns with the `templateTextFields` walk order (the share-link contract).

### Batch 3 — tighten passes-if-broken
- [ ] `legend.spec.ts:28/56` — assert realm/ocean *names* survive pins-off and
      that borders+names vanish with realms (a name/border proxy, not aggregate).
- [ ] `map-artifacts.spec.ts:47` — add a river-present lower bound.
- [ ] `rollers.spec.ts:98` — assert an undead monster in Forces; `:50` — assert
      the rerolled fragment changed and a sibling held.
- [ ] `smoke-srd-statblocks.mjs:118` — fail if the sample has no statblock section
      to attribute (don't green vacuously).
- [ ] `brews.spec.ts:32/73` — assert the test-roll output ∈ the table's entries.

### Batch 4 — smoke correctness
- [ ] `smoke-dnd5e.mjs` — pin one hand-computed exact `hpAverage`; tighten rolled
      HP to `[min,max]`.
- [ ] `smoke-hydro.mjs` — add the downhill/sink invariant (elevation non-increasing
      along each route, mouths on water/lake, `acc` monotonic).
- [ ] `smoke-geo.mjs` — assert each feature's centroid kind matches its biome.
- [ ] `smoke-terrain.mjs:124` — tighten G-3 to a relative gain (coastOn ≥ ~1.3×
      coastOff) and assert the interior didn't inflate.
- [ ] `smoke-settle.mjs` — assert highway-network connectivity (one component per
      continent), not just proximity-to-any-road.
- [ ] `smoke-dice.mjs` — add `2d20kl1` (disadvantage), a `dh` case, a negative term.
- [ ] `smoke-solo-cast.mjs:70` — full-output-minus-cast-slot compare (like SRD).

### Batch 5 — de-flake
- [ ] `map-perf.spec.ts:52/84` — gate on `median<45`; replace the p95 ms budget
      with a terrain-re-rasterization *count* proxy.
- [ ] `live-sheet:41`, `sheet-editor:11`, `rollers:69` — durability wait before
      reload/navigate.
- [ ] `visual-audit.spec.ts` — `expect(consoleErrors).toEqual([])` in afterAll +
      a pan-longtask budget assertion.
- [ ] `dice-skins.spec.ts` — guard against the 2.4s stage auto-dismiss.

### Batch 6 — de-brittle (optional)
- [ ] Compute, don't hardcode: statGrid counts, dice rgb, `gm-prep:55` monster,
      Earth census; assert the fantasy-name-on-real-coords claim in `earth-browser`.

## Missing coverage to add opportunistically
tracker tick + action roll on a *real inserted* block (insert-menu); foreign-world
`#map=…,@id` hash rejection + hash-write on pan/zoom; legend per-realm hide /
labels-off / section-collapse; secret-field & photo survive-reload / land-in-backup.
